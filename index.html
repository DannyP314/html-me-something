                    <h2>Our Hero's Story</h2>
                    <p>
                        <pre>
                                 Gyles Garnaut was a simple and humble farmer, and although Nidal was not always the most kind home, it was his home. His land had given him a beautiful wife and enough crops to live. And his beautiful wife Katherine and given him two sons and a daughter. There was not much more Gyles could ask for in a world that could be so unforgiving.

                        	     The eldest, John was 21, Katerina, the youngest and the only girl, was 7. Which left Oliver  squarely in the middle at 14. Ollie had just begun to learn the more exciting parts of farm life like hunting and what crops grew where and when. How long it grew and how to tell it was time to harvest. His favorite was harvesting. He didn’t mind hunting but he didn’t enjoy it as much as John or his father seemed to.

                        	     Early on the morning of his 15th birthday Ollie went into the woods to practice with his new bow, the one he wasn’t supposed to know about until later that day but he couldn’t help himself, the bow was beautiful. After a few hours he saw a tendril of smoke drifting lazily into the sky from the direction of home so he started back. Thinking of the delicious breakfast he was going to have. When he broke through the woods all of those thoughts disappeared instantly. The fields and barn were ablaze and several roamed the property bearing the insignia of the Nidalian military. He stopped and ducked back behind a tree as he watched a few soldiers march his family into the yard.

                                 “This is your last chance, Garnaut,” one soldier yelled. “Just agree to the terms so we can be on our way!”

                                 Gyles’ face was composed of both fear and stubbornness. “I cannot give you what you want.” he said shakily. “I have a family to care for!”

                                 “I don’t give a damn about your family!” the soldier responded.

                                 Ollie’s mother and sister hugged each others as Katerina sobbed. He nocked an arrow and began to creep forward. As he emerged from the shadows of the forest his father saw him before any of the soldiers. He shook his head slightly and Ollie stopped dead. Surely his father didn’t actually mean for him to stay put. He could hit at least two of the soldiers which would give his father and John enough time to attack the others. He drew back on the bow, his father shook his head once more and then lowered it slightly.

                        	     “If I agree to what you want, will you at least let my family go?”

                        	     “That all depends on how quickly you do what I say. And if you waste any more time,” the soldier grabbed Katerina by an arm and hauled her to her feet next to him.

                                 “I will start with your lovely little girl here.” Katerina began to scream in earnest and Katherine finally broke into sobbing tears, begging for her daughter’s life. John attempted to take his feet, but was quickly knocked back down by a soldier.

                                 “Please,” Gyles shouted. “Please let my family go. Take whatever you want. We will never come back here again!” He chanced another glance towards Ollie and tried to signal for him to leave. But Ollie didn’t quite catch on, although another soldier did.

                        	     “YOU! THERE! IN THE WOODS! COME OUT OF THERE!”

                        	     Ollie immediately turned and ran full tilt into the woods. The lead soldier commanded three others to follow Ollie while the other three stayed with Gyles and his family.

                        	     That was the last Oliver saw of his family. After he was sure the soldiers were retreating he went back towards his house. The entire house was ablaze now. and in front of the house was a small pile of what looked like bodies. Oliver couldn’t even bring himself to see if it was his family. He set off down the road to the nearest town of Wyebury hoping he could find out any information about his family or to get far away, but when he arrived in the town the soldiers were there and upon seeing him attempted again to catch him. Shouting about how he would tell them what he knew, and they would find him no matter what, and no one would believe him anyway.

                                 So Ollie fled into the woods once more. He stayed there for weeks with only his bow and the clothes on his back. One evening while he was settling in for the night he heard a soft whining noise. He found a wolf and her pups in a thicket. All of the other wolves were dead besides the one who was trying to wake his mother and siblings. Ollie slowly moved towards him and eventually got close enough that the wolf, though scared, finally sniffed him and apparently satisfied that Ollie would do him no harm snuggled up to him. Ollie took him back to his campsite and held the pup all night while he whined in his sleep. The two were inseparable from then on. He decided to call him Garnaut in honor of his family. He moved every day until he decided the soldier’s couldn’t possibly be looking for him anymore. He made his way back to Wyebury  only to find wanted posters with his likeness on them all over town.

                                 Ollie and Garnaut spent the years travelling and living mostly in the woods and mountains of various countries to escape the, assumed, ever watchful eye of the Nidalian soldiers, even going as far as to go by the name of Arrowbolt so that he would not be recognized. Eventually the soldiers assumed he was dead and Ollie spent less time looking over his shoulder and more time enjoying the life he had made for himself with Garnaut.

                                 Ten years later he finds himself looking for work and adventure in Brevoy. The pair have become accustomed to their rambling lifestyle and even find joy in the adventures that come their way, when a bounty hunter approaches Ollie saying that he knows who he is and that he’s going to turn him over to Nidal. Ollie and Garnaut made short work of him and left his body in the woods but what could he possibly know 10 years later that the military is still looking for him? Ollie slowly returns to watching over his shoulder and becomes slightly less lighthearted when the adventure begins.
